##WSN Remote Configuration panel and Knowledge Mining Base

This project is intended to design a sink side program to harvest the data from **Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)** and provide interface to analyze data with mining algorithm. It was initially started with vision to develop a smart wireless sensor fused device as **WSN** node for field inspection and production monitoring. Later on modified to auto setup energy aware routing in **WSN** for energy efficiency and data relaiability was added as feature.

###Note:-
This project is still under development and is Subjected to Department of **Institute of Engineering, Pashchimanchal Campus, Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering** as final year project for Bachelor's Degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering.
